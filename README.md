  Project Title:Neural Style Transfer using Deep Learning
Description:As part of my internship at CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS, I worked on implementing Neural Style Transfer (NST) â€” an advanced deep learning technique that applies the artistic style of one image to the content of another. The core objective of this project was to develop a Python-based solution capable of generating stylized images by combining the content of a photograph with the style of a painting.The implementation was done using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), particularly the VGG-19 model, which is well-suited for feature extraction. Neural Style Transfer works by extracting content features from higher layers of the network and style features from multiple layers using Gram matrices to represent textures and patterns.The process involves initializing a target image and iteratively optimizing it to minimize a combination of content loss and style loss, thereby producing a new image that captures the structure of the content image and the artistic texture of the style image.I used PyTorch as the deep learning framework due to its flexibility and extensive community support. Development was carried out in Visual Studio Code (VS Code), which provided a smooth workflow through features like code completion, integrated terminal, and debugging support.The project was developed using PyTorch, which offers great flexibility for custom model training and manipulation. Visual Studio Code (VS Code) was used as the integrated development environment due to its ease of use, support for Python extensions, real-time debugging, and virtual environment integration.This NST tool has wide-ranging applications in areas like art creation, social media filters, digital content production, augmented reality, and marketing. It enables artists, developers, and content creators to apply unique stylistic effects to images without manual editing.Overall, this project deepened my understanding of computer vision, convolutional networks, and the practical applications of deep learning in creative domains. It also helped strengthen my skills in model optimization, Python programming, and using modern AI frameworks.
